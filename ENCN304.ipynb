Using the estimate of the derivative at the current value of the solution and 'jumping ahead' can run the risk that we greatly overshoot. An unstable problem will compound these overshoots.\n",

    "2. Evaluate the gradient at the future guess: $f(t_{n+1}, x_{n+1}^{(0)})$\n",
    "3. Use the backward Euler step to update the guess of the future: $x_{n+1}^{(1)} = x_{n}+\\Delta t f(t_{n+1}, x_{n+1}^{(0)})$. This is called the **corrector**.\n",

    "Final note: because this method uses an Euler step, it is still subject to the conditional stability of the Euler method. Which would seem to defeat the purpose, because the principle advantage of implicit methods is supposed to be their unconditional stability. There are more complex versions of Backward Euler that use **Newton Iteration** instead of function iteration. Although these are unconditionally stable, they are too difficult for us to implement here."
